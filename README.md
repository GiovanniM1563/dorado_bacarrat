# Baccarat Game Description:
## Objective:

The objective of Baccarat is to bet on the hand that you think will have a higher value: Player, Banker, or a Tie.

## Card Values:
Each card has a specific value in Baccarat.
Number cards 2 to 9 have their face value.
Face cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) and 10s have a value of 0.
Aces have a value of 1.

## Game Setup:
The game is played with 8 decks of cards, each deck containing standard playing cards.
At the beginning of the game, the cards are shuffled to create the shoe of decks.

## Gameplay:
The game starts with the player and the banker each receiving two cards from the deck.
The values of the two initial cards for both the player and the banker are totaled.
If either the player or the banker has a total value of 8 or 9 with their two initial cards, this is called a "Natural", and no more cards are drawn.
If neither the player nor the banker has a "Natural", additional cards may be drawn based on specific rules.

### Player Does Not Draw a Third Card:
If the player's total hand value after the initial two cards is 6 or 7, the player stands (does not draw a third card).
If the player's total hand value is 0 to 5, the player draws a third card.

### Banker's Initial Hand:
If the banker's total hand value after the initial two cards is 7, the banker stands (does not draw a third card).
If the banker's total hand value is 0 to 2, the banker always draws a third card.

### Banker's Decision to Draw a Third Card:
If the player draws a third card, the banker's decision to draw or stand is based on the following rules:

If the banker's total hand value is 3:
    The banker draws a third card unless the player's third card is an 8.

If the banker's total hand value is 4:
    The banker draws a third card if the player's third card is 2 to 7.   

If the banker's total hand value is 5:
    The banker draws a third card if the player's third card is 4 to 7.
    
If the banker's total hand value is 6:
    The banker draws a third card if the player's third card is 6 or 7.

Once all cards have been dealt, the values of the player's and banker's hands are compared.

## Determining the Winner:
The hand with a value closest to 9 wins.
If the player's hand value is greater than banker hand value, the Player wins.
If the banker's hand value is greater than player hand value, the Banker wins.
If both the player hand value and banker hand values are equal, the Tie wins.

## Game Results:
After each round of the game, the results are displayed, showing the outcome (Player win, Banker win, or Tie).
